# 📸 Seam Carving Project

Welcome to our Seam Carving project! This project was developed as part of the "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition" course. Seam carving is a content-aware image resizing technique that allows you to resize images without distorting the important content. 

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, we implemented the seam carving algorithm to resize images by removing or adding seams. The algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the optimal seams to remove or add, ensuring that the important content of the image is preserved.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Version1.py**: Initial implementation of the seam carving algorithm.
- **Version2.py**: Optimized version with additional features.
- **Version3.py**: Final version with further optimizations and enhancements.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **Readme.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## 🖼️ Comparison of Versions

Below is an image illustrating the difference between Version 1 and Version 2. Version 1 does not use JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation, while Version 2 includes JIT for performance optimization.
